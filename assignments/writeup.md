   - Introduction: What is your species? Why is it important? What are some of the management, industry, or conservation decisions that could benefit from a forecast?
   - Data: What is the distribution in time and space of your data? What are the strengths, weaknesses, caveats?
   - Modeling: Go through your approach and results, including a projection to future climate conditions.
   - Implications: How does your prediction influence the decisions around this species that you discussed in the introduction? You can also discuss next steps or open questions.
 - Refer to the "Forecast Cards" questions we used to guide our discussions

Refer to the readings and lecture content to inform your write-up. One example of a paper that does a 2050 projection for the Gulf of Maine is Camille's paper on right whales. This goes much further than someone can do in a single month, but it's good context: https://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/article/9/1/00058/116780/Projecting-regions-of-North-Atlantic-right-whale
